感染后的土地，Boomer随处游荡，千万不要被沾上胆汁！

【规则】
1. 没有普通僵尸，平时只有Boomer（很多，很多……）
2. 一旦被胆汁吐中，会引来一波特感尸潮，包含除了Boomer、Witch之外的所有种类（四控警告），其中Tank血量在正常基础上减半
3. 特感退去，继续你小心翼翼的前进（小心转角处！）

Boomers are everywhere, be on your feet and don't get vomited!

[Rules]
1. No common infected, normally you can only see Boomers.（So many...）
2. Boomer vomits can attract a mob of Special Infected, in which includes all SI but Boomer themselves and witches.(Be careful not to get incapacited by four chargers!) Tank's health will be reduced to half i.e. 2000.
3. You four had successfully survived this wave of attack, be on your feet and don't get vomited again!
